            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">The Transforming Education Summit was convened in response to a global
                crisis in education – one of equity and inclusion, quality and relevance. Often slow and unseen, this
                crisis is having a devastating impact on the futures of children and youth worldwide. The Summit
                provided a unique opportunity to elevate education to the top of the global political agenda and to
                mobilize action, ambition, solidarity and solutions to recover pandemic-related learning losses and sow
                the seeds to transform education in a rapidly changing world.</p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">The way people learn is an outcome of millions of years of evolution and
                it cannot be changed with technology. In short, we learn through interaction by observing the world
                around us i.e. we make observations, conceptualise our observations and connect them into our existing
                understanding. When we connect observations we have made before, we just strengthen our current
                understanding. When adding new observations, we learn. When we make observations that don’t fit into our
                existing understanding, we might end up learning and at the same time changing our understanding
                radically. </p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">The donated books will also be utilised to set up libraries in various
                schools under ‘Happy School’ project of TEACH (teacher support, e-learning, adult literacy, child
                development and happy schools), one of the Rotary programmes.

                On a periodical basis, the club members will drive down to villages and give away the books to the
                needy. In future, they plan to approach various schools and encourage the student community to
                contribute to the cause. Interested can contact 9393100515.

                The poster launch programme was attended by MLAs P. Vishnu Kumar Raju and Palla Srinivas and president
                of Rotary Club Visakha Port City P.L.K. Murthy and its secretary R. Ramakrishna Rao.</p>
